# cinar 0.2.0
* Added:
  - `heatmap_differential` function to be able to plot the heatmaps
of a given comparison.
  - `show_comparisons` is added to see the available comparisons 
before you plot differential heatmaps.

* Changed:
  - `heatmap_plot` is now renamed to `heatmap_var_peaks`, which makes more sense.

# cinaR 0.1.1
This version is even cooler, lol:

- Comparisons are now sorted according to `contrast` order
- Added bulk RNA-seq support/documentation
- Removed many dependencies
- Small bug fixes and improvements

# cinaR 0.1.0
- `cinaR` is published in CRAN repository!
